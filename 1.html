<h3>1.1 Introduction</h3>
<p> Computer is an electronic device device derived from the Latin word "computere" which means to calculate. It accepts raw facts and figures as an input which are isolated and uninterpreted through input device, process it according to the requirement of the user or command supplied by the user, store it before and after processing of require and produce a meaningful information as an output through an output device. Generally, computer works on IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle. It follows GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out) algorithm which means the output is always based on the input supplied by the user. </p><br>

<h4>Characteistics of a Computer: </h4>
<div class="Character">
<h5>1. Speed</h5>
<p>Executing mathematical calculation, a computer works faster and more accurately than human. Computers have the ability to process so many millions (1,000,000) of instructions per second. Computer operations are performed in micro and nano seconds. A computer is a time saving device. It performs several calculations and tasks in few seconds that we take hours to solve. The speed of a computer is measure in terms of GigaHertz and MegaHertz.</p><br>

<h5>2. Diligence</h5>
<p>A human cannot work for several hours without resting, yet a computer never tires. A computer can conduct millions of calculations per second with complete precision without stopping. A computer can consistently and accurately do millions of jobs or calculations. There is no weariness or lack of concentration. Its memory ability also places it ahead of humans.</p><br>

<h5>3. Reliability</h5>
<p>A computer is reliable. The output results never differ unless the input varies. the output is totally depend on the input. when an input is the same the output will also be the same. A computer produces consistent results for similar sets of data, if we provide the same set of input at any time we will get the same result.</p><br>

<h5>4. Automation</h5>
<p>The world is quickly moving toward AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based technology. A computer may conduct tasks automatically after instructions are programmed. By executing jobs automatically, this computer feature replaces thousands of workers. Automation in computing is often achieved by the use of a program, a script, or batch processing.</p><br>

<h5>5. Versatility</h5>
<p>Versatility refers to a capacity of computer. Computer perform different types of tasks with the same accuracy and efficiency. A computer can perform multiple tasks at the same time this is known as versatility. For example, while listening to music, we may develop our project using PowerPoint and Wordpad, or we can design a website.</p><br>

<h5>6. Memory</h5>
<p>A computer can store millions of records. these records may be accessed with complete precision. Computer memory storage capacity is measured in Bytes, Kilobytes(KB), Megabytes(MB), Gigabytes(GB), and Terabytes(TB). A computer has built-in memory known as primary memory.</p><br>

<h5>7. Accuracy</h5>
<p> When a computer performs a computation or operation, the chances of errors occurring are low. Errors in a computer are caused by human’s submitting incorrect data. A computer can do a variety of operations and calculations fast and accurately. </p><br>

<h3>Application of Computer</h3>
<p>  The uses of computer are increased day by day. Every aspect if human life is highly influenced by computer. From simple domestic use to complex engineering and scientific solutions, computer can be used. This is due to the versatility of computer. Some of the basic implementation of computer are:</p></br>

<div class="Character">
<ol>
    <li>Education: Nowadays, computer are highly used in teaching and learning process. Many interesting graphics can be made and provided for easy learning. Also, computer provide features of internet which make learning easy and fun.</li>
    <li>Communication: Computer is massively used in communication. Communication is done by e-mail, chat, online conferencing. e-fax etc with help of internet in computer. It has made the communication faster, easier and cheaper.</li>
    <li>Business: In business sector, computer are used to generate invoice, maintain stock and make statistical analysis. E-commerce is the new and emerging way of buying and selling goods and service through used of electronic means and media.</li>
    <li>Engineering and designing: Scientific and engineering design requires complex and massive computations. Design of bridges, towers, buildings, generators, motors, electrical transmission etc requires precise computation which are done through computers.</li>
    <li>Science and research</li>
    <li>Military</li>
    <li>Industry</li>
    <li>Medicine</li>
    <li>Robotics</li>
    <li>Transportation</li>
