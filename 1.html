<div class="Character">
<h4>Characteistics of a Computer: </h4>
<h5>1. Speed</h5>
<p>Executing mathematical calculation, a computer works faster and more accurately than human. Computers have the ability to process so many millions (1,000,000) of instructions per second. Computer operations are performed in micro and nano seconds. A computer is a time saving device. It performs several calculations and tasks in few seconds that we take hours to solve. The speed of a computer is measure in terms of GigaHertz and MegaHertz.</p><br>

<h5>2. Diligence</h5>
<p>A human cannot work for several hours without resting, yet a computer never tires. A computer can conduct millions of calculations per second with complete precision without stopping. A computer can consistently and accurately do millions of jobs or calculations. There is no weariness or lack of concentration. Its memory ability also places it ahead of humans.</p><br>

<h5>3. Reliability</h5>
<p>A computer is reliable. The output results never differ unless the input varies. the output is totally depend on the input. when an input is the same the output will also be the same. A computer produces consistent results for similar sets of data, if we provide the same set of input at any time we will get the same result.</p><br>

<h5>4. Automation</h5>
<p>The world is quickly moving toward AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based technology. A computer may conduct tasks automatically after instructions are programmed. By executing jobs automatically, this computer feature replaces thousands of workers. Automation in computing is often achieved by the use of a program, a script, or batch processing.</p><br>

<h5>5. Versatility</h5>
<p>Versatility refers to a capacity of computer. Computer perform different types of tasks with the same accuracy and efficiency. A computer can perform multiple tasks at the same time this is known as versatility. For example, while listening to music, we may develop our project using PowerPoint and Wordpad, or we can design a website.</p><br>

<h5>6. Memory</h5>
<p>A computer can store millions of records. these records may be accessed with complete precision. Computer memory storage capacity is measured in Bytes, Kilobytes(KB), Megabytes(MB), Gigabytes(GB), and Terabytes(TB). A computer has built-in memory known as primary memory.</p><br>

<h5>7. Accuracy</h5>
<p> When a computer performs a computation or operation, the chances of errors occurring are low. Errors in a computer are caused by humanâ€™s submitting incorrect data. A computer can do a variety of operations and calculations fast and accurately. </p><br>
